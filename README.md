# Lecture Notes

This repository includes my *personal* lecture notes in TeX and pdf format so that they can be edited by the others. The lectures notes of the courses below can be found in this repository; plus, I am planning to add more. Please note the fact that necessary permissions are taken from the professors themselves before sharing these lecture notes because they contain quiz and exam questions asked the semester I took the courses.

1. COGS501 Algorithmic Structures in Congition (2019/2020 Spring)   [Original repo](https://github.com/bozsahin/cogs501)    **Completed**
2. COGS542 Grammars, Combinators and Coginition (2020/2021 Fall)    [Original repo](https://github.com/bozsahin/cogs542)    **Preparing**

For the completed lecture notes, you can also make revisions regarding the semester that you take the course and correct the mistakes.
